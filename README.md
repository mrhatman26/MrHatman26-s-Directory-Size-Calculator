# MrHatman26-s-Directory-Size-Calculator
A simple tool that calculates the size of your directories. Pretty pointless since Windows does this already, but... It... Calculates the largest file! Yeah!
<br>
To use it, simply run the executeable (or "main.py" if you are using the source code) and select your directory and click Calculate. You can also change the size unit it will calculate with. (Bytes, Killerbytes, Megabytes, etc.) 
<br>
This program was made using Python and uses the following libraries:
<br>-tkinter
<br>-os

Note:
-1.1.0: I have yet to remove the remnants of the Threading library.
